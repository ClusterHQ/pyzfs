This package provides a wrapper for libzfs_core C library.

libzfs_core is intended to be a stable interface for programmatic
administration of ZFS.
This wrapper provides one-to-one wrappers for libzfs_core API functions,
but the signatures and types are more natural to Python.
nvlists are wrapped as dictionaries or lists depending on their usage.
Some parameters have default values depending on typical use for
increased convenience.
Enumerations and bit flags become strings and lists of strings in Python.
Errors are reported as exceptions rather than integer errno-style
error codes.  The wrapper takes care to provide one-to-many mapping
of the error codes to the exceptions by interpreting a context
in which the error code is produced.
